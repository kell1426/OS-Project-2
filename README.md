The purpose of this program is to count up the votes in leaf nodes and aggregate the votes back up to the root node, which will then find the winner of the election. To representation of the nodes this time is using directories. There will be a root directory that acts as the root node, with multiple subdirectories. There can be any number of subdirectories at any point in the directory tree. The program will go through every folder and count up the votes.
To do this, three programs have been written. The first is Leaf_Counter. This program will open up the "votes.txt" file of a leaf node, count up the votes, and output it to a file with the same name as the path to the file. If it is called on a non-leaf node, it will print out "Not a leaf node."
The second program is Aggregate_Votes. This is the program that does most of the work. It can be called on any folder in the directory tree. Once called, it will open up every subdirectory. If the subdirectory is a non-leaf node, a child process will be spawned that runs Aggregate_Votes on the non-leaf node. If it is a leaf node, a child process will be spawned that runs Leaf_Counter on the leaf node. Once all child processes are finished, it will open up the output file of each subdirectory one level down. It will parse these files, and aggregate all the votes. A new output file will be made at the node where it was originally called that contains all the aggregated votes. The location of this file will be printed to the terminal.
The lats program is Vote_Counter. This program can be run on any node. It will spawn a child process that calls Aggregate_Votes on the current node. When it finishes, it will open up the output file generated by Aggregate_Votes and append the winner to the file.

I am in lecture section 10 (11:15-12:30) and my x500 is kell1426. I did this program individually, and I did not do the extra credit.
